      <h2>Developing!</h2>
      <p>My first introduction to programming was a class on C++ and Matlab, my freshman year of college. I remember spending 20 hours on a single project and having restless dreams that night about coding.
      After that experience, I was afraid of programming. Following the start of my first job, however, I was craving a challenge and stumbled upon dev bootcamp in Chicago. It got me thinking more about giving software development another chance. I picked up Eloquent JavaScript and loved it, every chapter felt like a new puzzle.
      Unfortunately the timing wasn't right yet, so I kept the idea of making a career change on the backburner until I was ready. After three years in automotive, I jumped out of my comfort zone and joined Grand Circus! </p>
